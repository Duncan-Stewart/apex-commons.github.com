[apex-commons](/) is a collection of open source [force.com](http://force.com) components organized into git repositories.  The top level repository is referred to as base and all other repositories reference it.  To get started, see [Install](/install).  We certainly welcome [contributions](/contribute) including contributions to documentation (this site is rendered using github pages and it's source can be viewed [here](https://github.com/apex-commons/apex-commons.github.com)).  apex-commons was inspired by the [Apache Commons](http://commons.apache.org/) project and was also ported in May 2011 from [apex-lang](http://code.google.com/p/apex-lang/).
